# ArithmeticCalculator

This is a small personal project written in Java to solve arithmetic operations from the console.

## Rules
- The calculator can only solve arithmetic operations on a single line.
- Only the following operations can be evaluated: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
- You must be explicit with the syntax in the operations. For example `2(3-5)+6/2` is not correct, the correct way would be `2*(3-5)+6/2`. 
- The hierarchy of operations is evaluated by the program itself.

**This is a preview of the program in console:**
